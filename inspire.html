        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>One of my personal heroes is Frida Kahlo. Frida Kahlo is a Mexican painter, born in 1907. She is one of Mexico's greatest artists, even after death. Frida's work often contain very personal themes of identity, pain, and the female experience. Her paintings mix surrealism with traditional Mexican folk art, creating many iconic works that are still hanging in prestigious museums today. Her unique personal style and unapologetic exploration of uncomfortable subjects such as gender, disability, and post-colonialism make her a power symbol for women and LGBTQ+ people around the world.</p>
